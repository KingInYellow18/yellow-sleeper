# Yellow Sleeper MCP MVP Decisions

## 2026-05-11 — Smoke Scenario Source

Decision: implement six smoke tests from the canonical behaviors implied by `TOOL_CONTRACTS.md` and `TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` because `PRD.md` v0.4.4 does not contain a section literally named `Success Metrics`.

Alternatives considered: pause for human clarification; create no smoke tests until the PRD is amended; use the examples embedded in `TOOL_CONTRACTS.md` plus the smoke example in `TECHNICAL_SPEC.md`.

Why this one: `goal.md` says the three source documents are frozen and to proceed with documented behavior while recording drift. The contracts/spec define enough canonical scenarios to build the required smoke suite.

## 2026-05-11 — MVP Pick Value Table

Decision: use an internal static MVP pick table by round: R1=3000, R2=1200, R3=600, R4=300, R5=100.

Alternatives considered: leave picks valueless; add YAML configuration; add an external dynasty pick-value source.

Why this one: the PRD names static table/config as the MVP pick-value source, while Stage 2 defers richer overlays. A small internal table keeps trade math complete for fixtures without adding a dependency or undocumented API.
